1. Player percentage considers all career penalties, not only from shootouts were the distribution might be different.

2. Use better method for imputing percentage of players with low sample size

3. For the single shootout function, print each iteration with a sleep to visualize the shootout unfold in real-time.

4. Create the optimized lineup: iteratively pick 5 players at random, for all possible orders for those 5 players create a scoring metric. This would be a combinatorial problem. Choose players and order that maximizes (or minimizes depending on the metric) the scoring parameters.
