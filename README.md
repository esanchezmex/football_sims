# Football Simulations

This repo will follow my attempts in creating football simulations based on the book Monte Carlo or Bust by Joseph Buchdahl.


## Penalty Simulation

Uses Monte Carlo method to recreate the World Cup Final penalty shootout between Argentina and France using real player data. Visualizations of histograms to evaluate differences in team goals, and statistical tests to check whether the distributions are different by chance (which they are not). 

In summary, Argentina deserved (were more likley by an entire goal) to win the penalty shootout.
